jQuery is a Javascript library that makes unsing Javascript easier. It's perfect for beginning coders to add some polish to a site, or experienced devs looking to build something quickly. The syntax is approachable, and feels like writing in plain English. jQuery has also been around for a long time, so there's lots of good learning and troubleshooting resources available if you get stuck.

## Your Project

### ← index.html

Where you'll write the content of your website. This is also where we're calling jQuery from [a cCDN](https://code.jquery.com/). You'll see the link in the `<head>` of the file.

### ← style.css

CSS files add styling rules to your content.

### ← script.js

This files is where all our Javascript lives. Since jQuery is a Javascript library this is where we're adding the custom interations.

### ← assets

Drag in `assets`, like images or music, to add them to your project
